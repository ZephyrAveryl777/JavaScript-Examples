# JavaScript Strings

- **`Objective :`** learn how to create and manipulate strings in JavaScript.

### Preface

A string is a sequence of letters, numbers, special characters and arithmetic values or combination of all. Strings can be created by enclosing the string literal (i.e. string characters) either within single quotes (') or double quotes (").

Escape sequences are also useful for situations where you want to use characters that can't be typed using a keyboard. Here are some other most commonly used escape sequences.

- \n is replaced by the newline character
- \t is replaced by the tab character
- \r is replaced by the carriage-return character
- \b is replaced by the backspace character
- \\ is replaced by a single backslash (`\`)
