# JavaScript Strict Mode

- **`Objective :`** learn how to execute your code in strict mode in JavaScript.

### Preface

The strict mode was introduced in ECMAScript 5 (ES5). It is a semantically stricter or restricted version of JavaScript language that produces errors for those mistakes that are handled silently otherwise. For example, in non-strict mode if you initialize a variable without declaring it using the **`var`** keyword (e.g. **`x = 5;`**), JavaScript interpreter will assume that you were referring to a global variable and if no such variable existed, it will automatically create one.

Also, features that are deprecated may also generate errors in strict mode. Hence, strict mode reduces bugs, improves security and overall performance of your application.

To enable strict mode all you need to do is just add the string _"use strict"_ at the beginning of your script
