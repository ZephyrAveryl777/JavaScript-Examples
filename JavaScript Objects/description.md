# JavaScript Objects

- **Objective :** learn how to create and use objects in JavaScript.

### Preface

JavaScript is an object-based language and in JavaScript almost everything is an object or acts like an object. So, to work with JavaScript effectively and efficiently we need to understand how objects work as well as how to create your own objects and use them.

A JavaScript object is just a collection of named values. These named values are usually referred to as properties of the object.
