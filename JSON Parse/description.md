# JSON.parse()

- **Objective :** learn how to parse JSON Objects and work with them.

### Preface

A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server.

When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string.

Parse the data with `JSON.parse()`, and the data becomes a JavaScript object.

You can request JSON from the server by using an AJAX request

As long as the response from the server is written in JSON format, you can parse the string into a JavaScript object.

When using the `JSON.parse()` on a JSON derived from an array, the method will return a JavaScript array, instead of a JavaScript object.

Parsing Dates
Date objects are not allowed in JSON.

If you need to include a date, write it as a string.

You can convert it back into a date object later:
