# JavaScript DOM Selectors

### Preface

JavaScript is most commonly used to get or modify the content or value of the HTML elements on the page, as well as to apply some effects like show, hide, animations etc. But, before you can perform any action you need to find or select the target HTML element.

This can be done in four individual or combined steps,

- _Selecting the Topmost Elements_
- _Selecting Elements by ID_
- _Selecting Elements by Class Name_
- _Selecting Elements by Tag Name_
- _Selecting Elements with CSS Selectors_
