- **Objective :** learn how to make a JavaScript powered web page.

### Preface

**Adding JavaScript to Your Web Pages**

There are typically three ways to add JavaScript to a web page:

- Embedding the JavaScript code between a pair of \<script> and \</script> tag.
- Creating an external JavaScript file with the .js extension and then load it within the page through the src attribute of the \<script> tag.
- Placing the JavaScript code directly inside an HTML tag using the special tag attributes such as onclick, onmouseover, onkeypress, onload, etc.
