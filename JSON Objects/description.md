# JSON Objects

- **Objective :** learn how to create JSON Objects and work with them.

### Preface

JSON objects are surrounded by curly braces {}.

JSON objects are written in key/value pairs.

Keys must be strings, and values must be a valid JSON data type (string, number, object, array, boolean or null).

Keys and values are separated by a colon.

Each key/value pair is separated by a comma.
