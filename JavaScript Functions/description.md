# JavaScript Functions

- **`Objective :`** learn how to define and call a function in JavaScript.

### Preface

A function is a group of statements that perform specific tasks and can be kept and maintained separately form main program. Functions provide a way to create reusable code packages which are more portable and easier to debug. Here are some advantages of using functions:

- **Functions reduces the repetition of code within a program** — Function allows you to extract commonly used block of code into a single component. Now you can perform the same task by calling this function wherever you want within your script without having to copy and paste the same block of code again and again.
- **Functions makes the code much easier to maintain** — Since a function created once can be used many times, so any changes made inside a function automatically implemented at all the places without touching the several files.
- **Functions makes it easier to eliminate the errors** — When the program is subdivided into functions, if any error occur you know exactly what function causing the error and where to find it. Therefore, fixing errors becomes much easier.
