# JavaScript Error Handling

- **`Objective :`** learn how to deal with errors gracefully in JavaScript.

### Preface

Sometimes your JavaScript code does not run as smooth as expected, resulting in an error. There are a number of reasons that may cause errors, for instance:

- A problem with network connection
- A user might have entered an invalid value in a form field
- Referencing objects or functions that do not exist
- Incorrect data being sent to or received from the web server
- A service that the application needs to access might be temporarily unavailable

These types of errors are known as runtime errors, because they occur at the time the script runs. A professional application must have the capabilities to handle such runtime error gracefully. Usually this means informing the user about the problem more clearly and precisely.
