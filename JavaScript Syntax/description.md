# JavaScript Syntax

- **Objective :** JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed.

### Preface

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

- **Fixed values:** Fixed values are called Literals.
- **Variable values:** Variable values are called Variables.

The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

1. Numbers are written with or without decimals.
1. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes.

JavaScript is case-sensitive. This means that variables, language keywords, function names, and other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.
